# About Me

Hey, and welcome to my profile. I'm just your typical cybersecurity student trying to learn more than I can handle. I'll keep my About Me simple, as I don't really have anything impressive to share.

I am not a developer, and I don't really plan on becoming one. I lack a lot of creativity, and unfortunately, when it comes to trying to learn languages, I fall short a little after the beginner concepts.

Currently Learning:
- Python
- Bash

Want to learn:
- C+
- HTML
- More to come... (Maybe)

This profile was created to showcase anything that I am proud to share with the public.
